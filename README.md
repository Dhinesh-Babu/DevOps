### Docker :

- Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.Containers are    isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.   All containers are run by a single operating-system kernel and are thus more lightweight than virtual machines.

### Kubernetes (K8s) :

- Kubernetes (K8s) is an open source system for automating deployment , scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.
